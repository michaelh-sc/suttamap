  "_comment": "This data is an early work-in-progress and contains errors. Keys with _else are produced with non-trained Stanford NLP and as such only includes capitalized words. The + designates a segment range. Produced by @michaelh at Discuss and Discover SuttaCentral forum - please get in touch! Finished code forthcoming. In this sutta, it is the same as Discourse with Sakka and 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 are replaced with these. So they are technically quotes, but not in quotes."
