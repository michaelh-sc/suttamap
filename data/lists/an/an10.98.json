    "The ten qualities of a senior mendicant who lives comfortably [an10.98:1.13]": [
      "They are senior and have long gone forth.",
      "They’re ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters.",
      "Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.",
      "They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.",
      "Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well judged in both the rules and accompanying material.",
      "They’re skilled in raising and settling disciplinary issues.",
      "They love the teachings and are a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training.",
      "They’re content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.",
      "They look impressive when going out and coming back, and are well restrained when sitting in an inhabited area.",
      "They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements."
