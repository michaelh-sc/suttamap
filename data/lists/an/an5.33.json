    "Advice to the girls [an5.33:12.4]": [
      "Parents will give them to a husband wanting what’s best, out of kindness and compassion. They will get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.",
      "Those their husband respects—mother and father, ascetics and brahmins—they will honor, respect, revere, and venerate, and serve with a seat and a drink when they come as guests.",
      "They will be skilled and tireless in doing domestic duties for their husband, such as knitting and sewing. They will have an understanding of how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.",
      "They will know what work their husband’s domestic bondservants, workers, and staff have completed, and what they’ve left incomplete. They will know who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. They will distribute to each a fair portion of various foods.",
      "They will ensure that any income their husbands earn is guarded and protected, whether money, grain, silver, or gold. They will not overspend, steal, waste, or lose it."

    "Qualities of a good woman [an5.33:12.4]": [
      "She’d never look down on her husband, who’s always eager to work hard, always looking after her, and bringing whatever she wants.",
      "A good woman never scolds her husband with jealous words. Being astute, she reveres those respected by her husband.",
      "She gets up early, works tirelessly, and manages the domestic help. She’s loveable to her husband, and preserves his wealth."
