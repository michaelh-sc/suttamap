    "The wishes of a mendicant [an10.71:13.2]": [
      "May I be liked and approved by my spiritual companions, respected and admired.",
      "May I receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.",
      "May the services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick I enjoy be very fruitful and beneficial for them.",
      "When deceased family and relatives who have passed away recollect me with a confident mind, may this be very fruitful and beneficial for them.",
      "May I be content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.",
      "May I endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. May I endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. May I endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And may I put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.",
      "May I prevail over desire and discontent, and may desire and discontent not prevail over me. May I live having mastered desire and discontent whenever they have arisen.",
      "May I prevail over fear and dread, and may fear and dread not prevail over me. May I live having mastered fear and dread whenever they arise.",
      "May I get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when I want, without trouble or difficulty.",
      "May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements."
