      "A person who is sure and devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, has laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and is endowed with freedom. They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. They are exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.",
      "A person who is sure and devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, has laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and is endowed with freedom. With the ending of the five lower fetters, they’re extinguished between one life and the next … they’re extinguished upon landing … they’re extinguished without extra effort … they’re extinguished with extra effort … they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.",
      "A person who is sure and devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, but doesn’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.",
      "A person who is sure and devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, but doesn’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters, they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.",
      "A person who isn’t sure or devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, but has the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. They accept the principles proclaimed by the Realized One after considering them with a degree of wisdom. This person doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm.",
