      "“Because of stinginess and negligence a gift is not given. Wanting merit, a smart person would give.”",
      "“When a miser fails to give because of fear, the very thing they’re afraid of comes to pass. The hunger and thirst that a miser fears hurt the fool in this world and the next. So you should dispel stinginess, overcoming that stain, and give a gift. The good deeds of sentient beings support them in the next world.”",
      "“Among the dead they do not die, those who, like fellow travelers on the road, are happy to provide, though they have but little. This is an ancient principle. Some who have little are happy to provide, while some who have much don’t wish to give. An offering given from little is multiplied a thousand times.”",
      "“Giving what’s hard to give, doing what’s hard to do; the wicked don’t act like this, for the teaching of the good is hard to follow. That’s why the virtuous and the wicked have different destinations after leaving this place. The wicked go to hell, while the virtuous are bound for heaven.”"

    "Reasons why a moral person’s gift is more valuable than a sacrifice (a multiple items expanded upon using repetitive or similar sentence structures) [sn1.32:18.2]": [
      "Some give based on immorality— after injuring, killing, and tormenting.",
      "Such an offering—tearful, violent— in no way equals the value of a moral person’s gift.",
      "That’s how it is that a hundred thousand people making a thousand sacrifices isn’t worth a fraction of what’s offered by such a person."
